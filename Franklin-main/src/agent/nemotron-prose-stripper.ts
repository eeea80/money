/**
 * Strip leaked reasoning prose from Nemotron-family models.
 *
 * NVIDIA's Nemotron Omni reasoning model emits its chain of thought as plain
 * text — without `<think>` tags or a separate reasoning_content channel — so
 * the think-tag stripper can't catch it. The reasoning prose is then concatenated
 * directly with the answer (often without even a separator), e.g.:
 *
 *   "The user asks: ... According to instructions, we must obey. Just output
 *    the tokenOMNI_E2E_OK"
 *
 * This module detects the reasoning preamble (heuristic: leading sentence
 * matches a known meta-reasoning opener) and strips everything up to and
 * including the last "answer-introducer" phrase ("just output the token",
 * "the answer is:", "output:", etc.). The stripped portion is returned as
 * `thinking` so it can be routed to the thinking display channel; the
 * remainder is the user-facing `answer`.

/**
 * Which models can put chain-of-thought in `content`?
 *
 * Scope correction (2026-08-31). A previous revision widened this to the
 * whole free tier on the theory that the pool leaks. Re-measured across token
 * budgets, that was wrong: the "leak" is max_tokens TRUNCATION. A Nemotron
 * reasoning model cut off mid-thought emits the partial trace in `content`
 * with finish_reason "length"; given room it returns a clean answer with
 * finish_reason "stop" and the trace in `reasoning_content`.
 *
 *   nemotron-3-nano-30b, same prompt, chat/completions:
 *     max_tokens 120 -> "length", content = "Okay, the user is asking..."
 *     max_tokens 300 -> "stop",   content = the actual answer
 *
 * So the fix is to give free calls room (see router/index.ts's classifier
 * budget and turn-analyzer.ts's), not to scrub output. This stays narrow — the
 * Nemotron family, the only models observed producing untagged prose — because
 * a wider net plus an opener match could truncate a legitimate answer that
 * happens to begin "The user asks...".
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION: the real discriminator is `finish_reason === "length"`,
 * which this module never sees — the streaming call site in agent/llm.ts
 * decides whether to strip before the finish reason arrives. Until that is
 * plumbed through, the opener list is the proxy for it, which is why the
 * openers must stay specific enough that an untruncated answer cannot match.
