/**
 * CodeGraph built-in MCP server integration.
 *
 * CodeGraph (https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph, MIT) builds a local
 * SQLite knowledge graph of a repo's symbols, call edges, and files via
 * tree-sitter, then serves it over MCP. For Franklin this is a direct USDC win:
 * agents answer "how does X work / what calls Y / trace this flow" from the
 * pre-built index instead of looping grep + read, which cuts tool calls (and
 * therefore paid LLM round-trips) sharply on real codebases.
 *
 * Shipped as a dependency, so `franklin` users get it with no extra install.
 * The npm package is a thin shim (`npm-shim.js`) that locates a per-platform
 * bundle (vendored Node 24 + app) and execs it — so we always launch it via
 * the user's own node against the shim, never a global `codegraph` on PATH.
 *
 * Opt out with FRANKLIN_CODEGRAPH=0 (or "false").
